#Postgres-Express-React-Redux todo app

I made this app as I was trying to solidify my understanding of the above technologies.

If you're interested in getting a copy of this running locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run 'npm install' to install all the required modules
3. Ensure that you have postgres installed on your machine, http://www.postgresql.org/
4. Set up a local postgres database called 'todo' on your machine.
	a. If you'd like to give it a different name, edit line 2 on models/database.js and change the end of the address to the name of your database.
5. Run 'webpack' to compile all the react/redux
6. Run 'npm start' to start the server
7. Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser to access the todolist site.

If you have any issues along the way, feel free to email me at mikeyjc@gmail.com or send me a message on twitter at @mijcooper and I'll be happy to help you get this setup.
